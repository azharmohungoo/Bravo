	\section{Introduction}
	
	This document aims to specify the functional and non-functional requirements of a document archiving system, as specified by Ms Vreda Pieterse of the Computer Science Department.
	
	It will serve as a means of communication between the client and developers as well as providing an elaboration and a clear discription of it's implementation specifications.
	
	\section{Vision}
	
	We intend to create a system that will allow authors and their co-authors to work on their research papers in an environment that reassures collaborative work, which in turn diminishes the time spent on papers with multiple authors. The following are what we plan to achieve:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Keep track of research papers.
		\item View meta-data of research papers.
		\item Allow multiple authors to collaborate on the same research paper.
		\item Different levels of authority, i.e. Admin, (Co)Author, User.
		\item View and edit the details, of a text based profile, of different researchers.
		\item Implemention as a website and an android application.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Background}
	
	We live in a world where time is valuable. We would like to do as much as we possibly can in the shortest amount of time. And if that's not possible, we work in teams to ensure that we achieve that goal.
	
	Reseacher papers tend to be fairly lengthy, and if completed by only one author, it could be quite a tedious process. Hence we propose a system which would make the storage and collaboration of research articles and papers effortless by producing an archive system.

	\subsection{Use case prioritization}
	This section specifies the level of importance of different use cases, prioritized in terms of the following 3 catogories: Critical, Important and Nice-To-Have. Each of which has a lesser importance than the previous one.
	
	\subsubsection{Critical:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item User gateaway
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Register user
			\item Login user
		\end{itemize}
		\item Research paper management
		\begin{itemize}
			\item View paper
			\item Publish paper
			\item Terminate paper
			\item Assign research paper's conference venue

			\item Determine date and time
			\item Identify user
		\end{itemize}
		\item Other
		\begin{itemize}
			\item System should only allow one primary author for each research paper. The rest should be co-authors
			\item Superuser, one to be above all other users to have complete control and access to the entire system
			\item Only metedata of the document will be posted, no documents will be posted
			\item Research documents are archived rather than deleted

	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Nice-To-Have:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Users can search for other users attending the same conference
		\item Data representation via bar charts of the units accumulated by researchers throughout the past years
	\end{itemize}
